Known Bugs: 
* Clicking media controls before selecting a song breaks app due to selected song being null. 
    * Fix would be to disable controlls is selected song is null

    * check songs load 
    * check selected song changes colour
    * check fast forward/ rewind changes the time by +/- 5 seconds
    * check remaining time decreases when play button clicked 

* Add screen size responsiveness
    * media queries changing the css grid structure
    * hide song list & show some kind of pop up / menu item to view the list
    * animate list slide in, css transition
